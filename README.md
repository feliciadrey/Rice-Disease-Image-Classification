# Sehatin Padi - Rice Leaf Disease Classification
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`Rice_Disease_Img_Classification.ipynb`) that implements a CNN-based model for automatic detection of rice leaf diseases using transfer learning. Multiple ImageNet-pretrained backbones were compared (EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121).

## Dataset & Quick stats
- Dataset: **3,829** images across **6** classes  
  `['Bacterial Leaf Blight', 'Brown Spot', 'Healthy Rice Leaf', 'Leaf Blast', 'Leaf scald', 'Sheath Blight']`
- Train/Val/Test split used in the notebook: **~70% train (2,681)** and remaining 30% split equally for validation and test (~574 each).
- Image size: **224 Ã— 224**
- Batch size: **32**
- Optimizer: **Adam** (learning rate **1e-4**)
- Loss: **sparse_categorical_crossentropy**
